# Churn prediction

- Checked the datatypes with which we have to deal.
- Changed our target variable to the datatype we want.
- Normalized the naming convention of the column and the values.
- Splitted the dataset into training and test dataset.
- Further divided training dataset into training and validation dataset.
- Divided the feature columns into categorical and numerical features.
- Checked for the features which will effect the most on our model.
- Created feature matrix using class from sklearn.
- Trained the model on LogisticRegression from sklearn.
- Predicted if the given customer with its features will churn or not.
- Refer the `churn_prediction.ipynb` file for better understanding.
